						<h1>Aikido</h1>
						<p> 
							Aikido (Japanese: 合気道 Hepburn: aikidō) [aikiꜜdoː] is a modern Japanese martial art developed 
							by Morihei Ueshiba (植芝 盛平) as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy, and religious 
							beliefs.  Aikido is often translated as "the way of unifying (with) life energy" or as 
							"the way of harmonious spirit".

								Nikyo, "the second technique", is one of the basic pinning techniques of aikido. 
								It contains a wrist twist that can be quite painful, if done with too much force. 
								For regular training in the dojo, it is important not to overdo the nikyo, or 
								members of the dojo will soon get their wrists damaged. 
								To improve your nikyo, work on precision and sensitivity, instead of force.

								Irimi (ee-ree-mee) is the second pillar of Aikido (Aikido techniques are structured 
								around six main pillars). Irimi involves entering deeply around or behind an attack 
								to defuse or neutralize the attack. The concept of irimi teaches one to blend with 
								or enter into an opponent’s attack to become one with the opponent’s 
								movement and leaving the opponent with nowhere to strike.

								A hakama is the skirt-like pants that some Aikidoka wear. It is a traditional 
								piece of samurai clothing. The standard gi worn in Aikido as well as in other 
								martial arts such as Judo or Karate was originally underclothes. Wearing 
								it is part of the tradition of (most schools of) Aikido.
